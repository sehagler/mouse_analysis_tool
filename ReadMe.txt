This code analyzes raw mouse position data for a computer session by a user in a sequence of mouse movements.  It also characterizes each mouse movement using a set of metrics.  The aim is to create a secondary database of mouse movements from data in a primary database of raw mouse position data.  The purpose of the secondary database is to function as a platform for data mining of mouse movements for biomedical research or clinical purposes.

The code is given in a form immediately usable within the original project that it was written for.  However, a number of files containing information about the subjects of the study that are used by the code in its present form have been removed.
